Arch-server
===========

These are my arch-server install files.
I use them as a base for my client machines too.

### Requirements
- Base packages group
- Sudo
- having a user with sudo rights

### How to use it
To install this base system, you just have to invoke restore.sh as the chosen user with sudo rights.
This will install some packages globally but also set the environment for the chosen user.
ssh.sh is a *bonus* script if you want to set up a ssh server quickly.

### Is it stable ?
Of course not. This code is not meant to be used in production.
The best is to read it and use some parts here and there for your personal use if you wan to.
